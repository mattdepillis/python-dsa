# Problem
Write a function that takes a string and and returns its run-length encoding. Run-length encoding is a form of lossless data compression in which runs (or streaks) of data are stored in a single value and count. Runs of 10+ should be split into multiple runs.

For example, python```run_length_encoding('AAA')``` should return ```'3A```, and python```run_length_encoding(AAAAAAAAAAAA)``` should return 9A3A.

# Solution
