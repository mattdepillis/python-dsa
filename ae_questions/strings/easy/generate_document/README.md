# Problem
Given a string of available characters to use (case sensitive + special characters), and a string (document) you want to generate from the available characters, write a function that returns a boolean indicating whether or not you were able to do so.

For example, python```generate_document('aheaollabbhb', 'hello')``` should return ```True```.
