# Problem
Write a function that takes in a string of lowercase English letters and returns the index of the string's first non-repeating character. If there is no non-repeating character, return -1.

For example, python```non_repeating_character('hello')``` should return ```0```.

# Solution


**Pseudocode:**
- 

**Big O:**
- O(n + m) time, where n = len(characters) and m = len(document)
  - 
- O(c) space, where c = # of unique characters in characters string
  -
