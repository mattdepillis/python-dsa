# Problem
Write a function that takes in a binary tree's root node and returns an array containing the sums of all the paths in the tree.

For example, python```node_depths(tree.root, depth=0)``` where tree looks as follows:

        10
      /    \
     5      13
    / \    /  \
   4   7  12   16

should return ```10```.
